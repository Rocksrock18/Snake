# Snake

Uses a genetic algorithm with a neural network to train the computer to play snake.

## Game Objective

You play as a snake, where your goal is to become as long as possible.
Eating food makes your snake longer.

* If the snake runs into a wall or itself, it dies.

* If the snake goes 500 moves without getting food, it dies.

### Controls

The snake moves on its own, but its direction is controlled using the arrow keys.

## Training Computer

You can choose to let the computer learn to play.

When doing so, the computer will simulate a number of generations with random snake AIs.

* **Note** - Depending on how many generations you simulate, training can take a long time.

After the training completes, the computer will keep the best snake from the last generation. You can then play a normal game with the trained snake.
